Hello World! I Just wanted to introduce myself. I am just a kid in the grand scheme of things but life is starting to feel a little different now.
I have responsibilities and the freedom to make my own financial decisions. But with that comes the committment of 40 hours a week to a full time job.
This stage in my life has its ups and downs, but at the end of the day, I am happy with the direction things are headed. Just. Stick. With it :)
